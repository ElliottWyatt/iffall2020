<h1>Intro-Questions</h1>
<p>My name is Elliott Wyatt
    I am a junior year Communication Design 
    major. I come ffrom an illustration background with my work but am very interested in web-based art.
    I have a little experience in coding html and have made a web-zine which can be found <a href="https://meltedzine.neocities.org/">here</a>
    I hope to learn how to create Interactive elements on a website from this class.
    I think designing on a screen will be different from designing for print because of the capacity to scroll and the plethora of interative and moving elements available.
    This website has appealing design because of its innovative use of illustrated components which respond to the user: <a href="http://www.patrickwoodroffe-world.com/archive/">link</a>
    This website communicates effectively because of appealing but restrained design: <a href="http://www.thesmudgepaper.com/about">link</a>
    This website works well because it showcases the artist's work in a way which is styilsh and unique but simple to mavigate and doesn't destract from the images themselves: <a href="https://analog3vil.neocities.org/gifs.html">link</a>
